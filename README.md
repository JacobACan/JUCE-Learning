## What is RGBA Synth
RGBA Synth allows you to create a retro feeling synth sound by combining together sawtooth, square, saw, and sin waves. Through the use of a few sliders controlling each of their presence within the sound, RGBA Synth allows you to make a simple, yet unique sound. Each one of these sounds is mapped to a color in RGBA color space.

## Maintenance Status
This plugin is in beta, and we are eager to hear feedback on bugs and ideas for the synth going forward.
- This being a passion project and an endeavor I do on the side, this project is SLOWLY MAINTAINED.
- Though we are eager to hear feedback, I am currently a one man team and working full time on other projects other than this one.  Despite this I'd love to hear feed back and or any examples of its use in the wild üòÅ
